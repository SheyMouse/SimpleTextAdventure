##  A simple text adventure which takes a player linearly through a set of   ##
##  rooms.                                                                   ##
##  Each room has an obstacle to get past, with one solution, one failure to ##
##  take you back to the beginning, and a second fail to kill you.           ##
##                                                                           ##
##  This looks like a "My first game" adventure. That's because it is. Do    ##
##  not expect Zork on the first attempt.                                    ##

v0.3
Full game logic is in, complete with cheesy text.
Still a lot ot do, as can be seen by the TODO list at the top, but the basic
game works. 

v0.2
Progress and bug fixes

Some logic bugs fixed
Player can now go all the way through the game.

Also as part of this checkin, I have added a resources folder which contains the flow diagram
and mind map I used to help design the game.

v0.1
Initial version

The game can be played end-to-end, but there are a couple of bugs which still 
need to be sorted out.
Also, there is still a lot of debug story text which needs to be removed and the
story entered. 
There is a TODO section of the code. See that for my wish list, and bugs when I can
be bothered to update it.
